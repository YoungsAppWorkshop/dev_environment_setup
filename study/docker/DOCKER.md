# Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com) is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run applications. Docker lets you quickly assemble applications from components and eliminates the friction that can come when shipping code. Docker lets you get your code tested and deployed into production as fast as possible.

With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. 'Dockerized' apps are completely portable and can run anywhere - colleagues' macOS and Windows laptops, QA servers running Ubuntu in the cloud, and production data center VMs running Red Hat.

## 1. Installation

- [Installation Guide](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Docker/)

## 2. Useful Docker Commands

### 2.1. `docker build`

Build an image from a Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build [DOCKERFILE PATH]
```

**Example**:

Build an image tagged `my-org/my-image` where the Dockerfile can be found at `/tmp/Dockerfile`.

```bash
docker build -t my-org:my-image -f /tmp/Dockerfile
```

**Useful flags**:

- `--file -f` Path where to find the Dockerfile
- `--force-rm` Always remove intermediate containers
- `--no-cache` Do not use cache when building the image
- `--rm` Remove intermediate containers after a successful build (this is `true`) by default
- `--tag -t` Name and optionally a tag in the `name:tag` format

### 2.2. `docker exec`

Execute a command inside a running container.

```bash
docker exec [CONTAINER ID]
```

**Example**:

```bash
docker exec [CONTAINER ID] touch /tmp/exec_works
```

**Useful flags**:

- `--detach -d` Detached mode: run command in the background
- `-it` This will not make the container you started shut down immediately, as it will create a pseudo-TTY session (`-t`) and keep STDIN open (`-i`)

### 2.3. `docker images`

List all downloaded/created images.

```bash
docker images
```

**Useful flags**:

- `-q` Only show numeric IDs

### 2.4. `docker inspect`

Shows all the info of a container.

```bash
docker inspect [CONTAINER ID]
```

### 2.5. `docker logs`

Gets logs from container.

```bash
docker logs [CONTAINER ID]
```

**Useful flags**:

- `--details` Log extra details
- `--follow -f` Follow log output. Do not stop when end of file is reached, but rather wait for additional data to be appended to the input.
- `--timestamps -t` Show timestamps

### 2.6. `docker ps`

Shows information about all running containers.

```bash
docker ps
```

**Useful flags**:

- `--all -a` Show all containers (default shows just running)
- `--filter -f` Filter output based on conditions provided, `docker ps -f="name="example"`
- `--quiet -q` Only display numeric IDs

### 2.7. `docker rmi`

Remove one or more images.

```bash
docker rmi [IMAGE ID]
```

**Useful flags**:

- `--force -f` Force removal of the image

### 2.8. `docker run`

Creates and starts a container in one operation. Could be used to execute a single command as well as start a long-running container.

**Example**:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
```

This will start a ubuntu container with the entrypoint `/bin/bash`. Note that if you do not have the `ubuntu` image downloaded it will download it before running it.

**Useful flags**:

- `-it` This will not make the container you started shut down immediately, as it will create a pseudo-TTY session (`-t`) and keep STDIN open (`-i`)
- `--rm` Automatically remove the container when it exit. Otherwise it will be stored and visible running `docker ps -a`.
- `--detach -d` Run container in background and print container ID
- `--volume -v` Bind mount a volume. Useful for accessing folders on your local disk inside your docker container, like configuration files or storage that should be persisted (database, logs etc.).

## 4. Tips and Tricks

A collection of useful tips and tricks for Docker.

### 4.1. Delete all containers

**NOTE**: This will remove ALL your containers.

```bash
docker container prune
```

OR, if you're using an older docker client:

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### 4.2. Delete all untagged containers

```bash
docker image prune
```

OR, if you're using an older docker client:

```bash
docker rmi $(docker images | grep '^<none>' | awk '{print $3}')
```

### 4.3. See all space Docker take up

```bash
docker system df
```

### 4.4. Get IP address of running container

```bash
docker inspect [CONTAINER ID] | grep -wm1 IPAddress | cut -d '"' -f 4
```

### 4.5. Kill all running containers

```bash
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
```
